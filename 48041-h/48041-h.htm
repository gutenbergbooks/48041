<h2><a name="To_the_Student" id="To_the_Student"></a>To the Student.</h2>


<p>This book is designed as a text-book for amateurs,
students, and others who wish to take up a systematic
course of elementary electrical experiments at home or in
school.</p>

<p>The student is advised to begin at the beginning, to
perform the experiments in the order given, and to understand
each step before proceeding. Certain principles
and explanations necessarily precede the practical and
perhaps more interesting applications of those principles.</p>

<p>In selecting the apparatus for the experiments in this
book, the author has kept constantly in mind the fact
that the average student will not buy the expensive
pieces usually described in text-books.</p>

<p>The two hundred experiments given can be performed
with simple, inexpensive apparatus; in fact, the student
should make at least a part of his own apparatus.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who wish to make their own
apparatus, the author has given, throughout the work,
explanations that will aid in the construction of certain
pieces especially adapted to these experiments. For
those who have the author's "How Two Boys Made
Their Own Electrical Apparatus," constant references
have been made to it as the "Apparatus Book," as this
contains full details for making almost all kinds of simple
apparatus needed in "The Study of Elementary Electricity
and Magnetism by Experiment."</p>

you are trying to do. Read the directions carefully,
then begin.</p>

<p>Don't rush through an experiment to see what happens

<span class="f75">IRON AND STEEL.</span></h3>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_1"></a><i><b>1. Introduction.</b></i> We should know something about
iron and steel at the start, because we are to use them in
nearly every experiment. The success with some of the
experiments will depend largely upon the quality of the
iron and steel used.</p>

<p class="para">When we buy a piece of iron from the blacksmith, we
get more than iron for our money. Hidden in this iron
are other substances (carbon, phosphorus, silicon, etc.),
which are called "impurities" by the chemist. If all
the impurities were taken out of the iron, however, we
should have nothing but a powder left; this the chemist
would call "chemically pure iron," but it would be of no
value whatever to the blacksmith or mechanic. The
impurities in iron and steel are just what are needed to
hold the particles of iron together, and to make them
valuable. By regulating the amount of carbon, phosphorus,
etc., manufacturers can make different grades and
qualities of iron or steel.</p>

<p class="para">When carbon is united with the <i>pure</i> iron, we get what
is commonly called iron.</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_2"></a><i><b>2. Kinds of Iron and Steel.</b></i> <i>Cast iron</i> is the
most impure form of iron. Stoves, large kettles, flatirons,
etc., are made of cast iron. <i>Wrought iron</i> is the<span class="pagenumpara"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
purest form of commercial iron. It usually comes in
bars or rods. Blacksmiths hammer these into shapes to
use on wagons, machinery, etc. <i>Steel</i> contains more
carbon than wrought iron, and less than cast iron.</p>

<p><i>Soft steel</i> is very much like wrought iron in appearance,
and it is used like wrought iron.</p>

<p><i>Hard steel</i> has more carbon in it than soft steel. Tools,
needles, etc., are made of this.</p>

very valuable material; the same piece may be made hard
or soft at will. By sudden cooling, the steel becomes very
hard. This process is called <i>hardening</i>, but it makes the
steel too brittle for many purposes. By <i>tempering</i> is
meant the "letting down" of the steel from the very
hard state to any desired degree of hardness. This may
be done by suddenly cooling the steel when at the right
temperature, it not being hot enough to produce extreme
hardness. (The approximate temperature of hot steel
can be told by the colors which form on a clean surface.
These are due to oxides which form as the steel gradually
rises in temperature.)</p>

due to the proper amount of carbon in it. If you have performed

are obliged to use soft iron for some parts of electrical

<p><i>The Horseshoe Magnet</i>, H M (<a href="#FIG_2">Fig. 2</a>), is the most
popular form of small magnets. The red paint
has nothing to do with the magnetism. The
piece, A, is called its <i>armature</i>, and is made of
soft iron, while the magnet itself should be
made of the best steel, properly hardened. The
armature should always be in place when the
magnet is not in use, and care should be taken
to thoroughly clean the ends of the magnet
before replacing the armature. The horseshoe magnet is
<i>artificial</i>, and it is called a <i>permanent</i> magnet, because it
retains its strength for a long time, if properly cared for.</p>

Substances which are attracted by a magnet are said to be

not a magnet. Very strong magnets show that nickel,
oxygen, and a few other substances not containing iron,
are also magnetic. Some elements are actually repelled
by a powerful magnet; these are called <i>diamagnetic</i>
bodies. It is thought that all bodies are more or less
affected by a magnet.</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_16"></a><i><b>16. Practical Uses of Magnets.</b></i> Many practical
uses are made of magnets, such as the automatic picking
out of small pieces of iron from grain before it is ground
into flour, and the separation of iron from other metals,
etc. The most important uses of magnets are in the
compass and in connection with the electric current, as in
machines like dynamos and motors. (See experiments

steel will attract iron after merely touching a magnet.
To thoroughly magnetize it, however, a mere touch is
not sufficient. There are several ways of making magnets,

For these experiments, the student needs only a
good horseshoe magnet, or, better still, the electro-magnets

This bringing into line the particles of iron
indicates that each particle became a magnet. This
experiment should aid in understanding what is thought
to take place when steel is magnetized. The pile of
filings represents the body to be magnetized, and each
little filing stands for a particle of that body. A bar of
steel is composed of extremely small particles, called <i>molecules</i>.
They are very close together and do not move
from place to place as easily as the pieces of filings. A
magnet, however, when properly rubbed upon the steel,
seems to have power to make the molecules point in the
same direction. This produces an effect upon the whole
bar.</p>

<p class="para">Each molecule of the steel is supposed to be a magnet.
When these little magnets pull together, the whole bar
becomes a strong magnet. When a magnet is jarred,
and the little magnetized molecules are mixed again, they
pull in all sorts of directions upon each other. This lessens
the attraction for outside bodies.</p>

<p class="para">Steel is said to be <i>saturated</i>, when it contains as much
magnetism as possible. A piece of steel becomes slightly
longer when magnetized.</p>

around each molecule, making a little magnet of
it. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIII">electro-magnets</a>.)</p>

the steel. Thin steel may be magnetized practically
through and through. A thick magnet has but a crust
of magnetized molecules; in fact, a thick magnet may be
greatly weakened by eating the outside crust away with
acid. By riveting several thin bar or horseshoe magnets
together, thick permanent magnets of considerable
strength are made.</p>

It is evident, from the last 3 experiments, that lines of
force will pass through iron whenever possible, on their
way from the N to the S pole of a magnet. When the
armature of a horseshoe magnet is in place, most of the
lines of magnetic induction crowd together and pass
through it rather than push their way through the air.
Air is not a good conductor of lines of force; and the
magnet has to do work to overcome the resistance of the
air, when the armature is removed, in order to complete
the magnetic circuit. This work causes a magnet to
become gradually weaker. The soft iron armature is an
excellent conductor of lines of force; it completes the
magnetic circuit so perfectly that very little work is left
for the magnet to do.</p>

to have its S pole slightly weighted, as suggested by the

horizontal. The magnetic needle

we pass toward the north or south on the earth, the

or enter the earth's magnetic poles. What position

<p class="para"><a id="PARA_100"></a><i><b>100. Some Varieties of Electricity.</b></i> <i>Static electricity</i>
does not seem to "flow in currents" as readily as
some other varieties; its tendency is to stand still, hence
the name, static. The simplest way to produce it is by
friction. <i>Thermo electricity</i> is produced by changes in
temperature. When certain combinations of metals become
hotter or colder, a current is produced. <i>Voltaic</i> or
<i>Galvanic electricity</i> is produced by chemical action. Batteries
give this variety. <i>Induced electricity</i> is produced
by other currents, and by combinations of magnets and
moving coils of wire, as in the dynamo. This is, by far,
the most important variety of electricity, and the dynamo
is the most important producer of it.</p>

<p class="para">Each of the above varieties of electricity will be studied
experimentally with simple apparatus.</p>

Bodies.</b></i> The ebonite sheet became <i>electrified</i> or <i>charged</i>;
and as the <i>electrification</i> was produced by friction, we may
say that the action of the ebonite indicated the presence
of <i>frictional electricity</i>. No one can tell <i>just</i> why the
ebonite acted so queerly, but we can learn a great deal by
experimenting. Bodies which are not charged are said
to be <i>neutral</i>. The table, chairs, earth, etc., are neutral.
We may consider that a neutral body has been <i>discharged</i>.</p>

once have the water in the tank we have accomplished
something. The water has <i>potential energy</i>; that is, on
account of its high <i>position</i>, we can make it do some work
by simply turning a stop-cock so that the water can run

The simple muscular exertion on our part has been
changed to heat, light, and sound. The most wonderful
part of it all, however, is that we have electrified or
charged the ebonite. <i>We</i> did the work at first, and now
the ebonite has the power to do something, as you will<span class="pagenumpara"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>

warmth. We can force a cold body to become hot; in
other words, we can get it into a hot condition in various
ways, such as rubbing it, hammering it, or by placing it
near or in contact with another hot body.</p>

<p class="para">Electrification is, also, a condition or state into which
we can force a body; but electrification isn't electricity.
We know whether a body is hot or cold by its effects
upon us, upon thermometers,

other bodies. We can
tell, also, whether a body
is electrified or not by
the way it acts, and, in

The above terms are merely relative. Static

electricity is practically insulated by it. A substance
may be an insulator for currents of low potential,
while at the same time it will conduct high potential currents.

alone, or a good hard-rubber comb, may be used for
many experiments in frictional electricity, the sparks
produced are small, and the ebonite has to be electrified
as often as it is discharged. To obtain real good sparks,
and to avoid this continual rubbing, the student should
be provided with an <i>e-lec-troph'-o-rus</i>. This is, really, a
simple, cheap, and efficient frictional electric machine. An
electrophorus consists of 2 insulators and 1 conductor&mdash;that
is, of 3 parts: (1) insulating handle, (2) cover, and
(3) a plate or base of insulating material.</p>

The hole has been made a little larger

fit tightly in the hole, so that you can lift
E C, wrap a small piece of paper around
the end of E R before pushing it into the hole. You can easily
find out how much paper to use to make a good fit. With a knife

E R; this is <i>important</i>. The top and bottom of E C should be

from a high place to a lower one. Electrification acts
very much like water in this respect. We say that
water has a <i>pressure</i>, or a <i>head</i> of so many feet. In
speaking of a charge, we say that it has a <i>potential, or
an electro-motive force</i>. Water may have a high or low
pressure, and a charge may have a high or low potential.
The greater the pressure of water, the harder it tries to
break away and get somewhere; the greater the potential
of a charge, the farther it will jump to your hand.</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_144A"></a><i><b>144a. Current; Spark.</b></i> Electrification will easily
pass from a place of high potential to one of low potential
through a conductor, and when it <i>passes</i> we say we
have an <i>electric current</i>, or a <i>current of electricity</i>. Water
has no desire to flow on a dead level, and the electric
current does not care to flow between two places of equal
potential. The potential of the earth and of all neutral
bodies is zero; that is, they have no charge, no potential;
so it is very easy for a charge to escape into the earth.</p>

<p class="para">Dry air is a pretty good insulator, but when the attraction
between a charged and a neutral body gets great
enough, the spark rips right through the air. Benjamin
Franklin proved by experiment that lightning is caused
by the electrification in the clouds and air. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">Atmospheric
Electricity</a>.)</p>

potential. If the potential of a body becomes greater than that
of the earth, the body is said to be positively electrified; if the
potential of the body is less than that of the earth, it is said
to be negatively electrified. If we fill a bottle with sea water,
we have a great deal of water when we compare it with the bottle,
but a very little water when we compare it with the sea. The
earth is so large that small amounts of electrification taken from
it or added to it do not affect its potential to any extent.</p>

<p><a id="PARA_146"></a><b>146.</b> <i>The "Two-Fluid" Theory</i> suggests that there are two
absolutely different kinds of electrification, one called positive (+),
and the other negative (-). When these two are equal in
quantity, the body is said to be neutral. If the body contains
more + than -, the body is said to be charged positively.</p>

<p>It is evident then, if the two-fluid theory be accepted, that no
matter how strongly a
body is charged positively
there must be in it <i>some</i>
negative electrification;
that is, we may charge a
neutral body + by adding
+ electrification to it, or
by taking - electrification
from it. There must always
be, then, some +
and - electrifications in a
body.</p>

<p>These theories do not
require much consideration by the student of elementary electricity.
The best thing he can do is to learn what electricity can
do, and how it can be used.</p></div>

The movement of the air particles may be so great that
a lighted candle will be affected when placed near the

study of magnetism you learned that a magnet can act
through the air, and induce a piece of iron to become a
magnet. You saw how the iron filings arranged themselves
around the magnet, showing that the lines of force
reached out from the poles in a very peculiar manner.
There is an <i>electric field</i> all around a charged conductor,
just as there is a magnetic field about a magnet. The
lines of force in the
electric field pass from
the positively charged
body to the negatively
charged one, or to some
neutral one, which, you
will soon see, is practically
the same thing.
When the positively
charged electrophorus
cover is held above the negatively charged ebonite sheet,
a very strong electric field exists between them.</p>

This experiment should remind the student
of <a href="#EXP_24">Exp. 24</a>, in magnetism, in which a piece of soft iron
was magnetized by the inductive action of a magnet.
The soft iron was in a magnetic field; it became polarized.
Is it possible that the box, T B, was polarized, being in
the electric field of E C?</p>

<p class="para">We know, by the action of C T (<a href="#FIG_42">Fig. 42</a>), that the top
end of T B was charged while E C was in place. The
charge was not conducted.</p>

<p class="para">You know, from previous experiments, that + and -
electrifications rush together whenever possible. Why
can we not suppose that a neutral body, like the box at
the start, contains an equal amount of both kinds, and
that these different electrifications have already rushed
together?</p>

<p class="para">If you imagine a small army of positive soldiers struggling,
"man to man," with the same number of equally
strong negative soldiers, you can readily see that one-half
of them can hold the other half from running away. A
body remains neutral, then, according to this idea, as long
as it has an equal quantity of the two opposite kinds of
electrification. (See Theories, <a href="#PARA_145">&sect; 145</a>, <a href="#PARA_146">146</a>.)</p>

<p class="para">As soon as the positively charged E C was brought<span class="pagenumpara"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
near T B, it destroyed the neutrality of T B, by pulling
at its - electrification, and by pushing back its + electrification
to the top end and into C T. We say that the
charged E C produced a separation of the combined electrifications
of T B by <i>induction</i>, and not by contact. As
soon as the inductive action of E C was removed, T B
became neutral again.</p>

overcome by the repulsion for the +; the result being that
T P was not strongly attracted by E C until the + had a
chance to escape. The moist tissue-paper allowed its +
to escape more quickly than the dry piece. A conductor
is attracted by a charged body more strongly than an insulator,
because the latter is not easily polarized. A

<div class="expblock">

<p>E C was positively charged (<a href="#EXP_80">Exp. 80</a>). This also charged F B
positively by contact. F B acted inductively through the dielectric,
E S, drawing up <i>some</i> of the - in I T, and repelling <i>some</i> of
the +. As I T was insulated, this free + electrification could
not escape. Before we touched I T, its + and - electrifications,
although partially separated, were struggling against this inductive
action; and, on account of their strong attraction for each
other, our efforts to charge the condenser were retarded. Upon
touching I T the free + escaped to the earth. (This was the cause
of the spark.) This left <i>some</i> - electrification bound on the
underside of E S, and some + bound on the upperside of E S.
The capacity of F B was increased by this process, as the +<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
already put into it was very much occupied by the attractions
of the induced - just under E S. As more + was given to F B,
more - was drawn up under E S and more + was pushed out of
I T. This action went on until the two conductors were strongly
and oppositely charged. This action goes on continuously when
the lower conductor is grounded. The spark between the tins
was due to the rushing together of the + and - electrifications;
it showed that there was a <i>momentary current of electricity</i>.</p></div>

<p class="para"><a id="PARA_216"></a><i><b>216. Static Electric Machines</b></i> are used to produce
large quantities of static electricity. In the early
forms, the electrification was produced by friction.
Modern machines depend upon the principle of induction.
The electrophorus (<a href="#EXP_68">Exp. 68</a>) is really a very simple form
of induction machine. The potential of these machines
is very great, as the spark may jump many inches.
Thousands of Galvanic cells would be needed to make a
spark an inch long. When the spark passes through the
air it meets with an extremely high resistance, as air
practically insulates ordinary electricity. This high
resistance in the circuit reduces the strength of the
current. While the potential is very high, the strength
of the current is very low. (See Ohm's Law.)</p>

<p class="para"><a id="PARA_217"></a><i><b>217. Atmospheric Electricity.</b></i> The air is generally
electrified, even in clear weather. Its charge is
usually +. Clouds are sometimes +, and sometimes -.</p>

<p class="para">The cause of atmospheric electricity is not thoroughly
understood. It is thought, by some, to be due to the
friction of the particles of vapor upon each other. It is
also thought that the evaporation of sea water, and the
friction of winds, produce it.</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_218"></a><i><b>218. Lightning.</b></i> Benjamin Franklin, in 1752,
proved by his famous kite experiment that atmospheric
and frictional electricities were of the same nature. By
means of a kite, the string being wet by the rain, he
succeeded, during a thunder-storm, in drawing sparks,
charging condensers, etc.</p>

<p class="para">Lightning may be produced by the passage of electricity
between clouds, or between the cloud and the
earth, which, with the intervening air, have the effect of
a condenser. If one cloud is charged, it acts inductively
upon another, producing in it the opposite kind of
electrification. When the attraction between the two
electrifications becomes great enough, it overcomes the
resistance of the air, and lightning is produced.</p>

<p class="para">The flash is practically instantaneous. The direction
taken seems to depend upon the conditions of the surrounding
air. It has generally a zigzag motion, and is
then called <i>chain lightning</i>. The air in the path of the
electricity becomes intensely heated; it is this effect, and<span class="pagenumpara"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
not the electricity which we see. In hot weather flashes
are often seen which light up whole clouds, no thunder
being heard. This is called <i>heat lightning</i>, and is generally
considered to be due to distant discharges, the light
of which is reflected by the clouds.</p>

<p class="para">The <i>potential</i> of the lightning spark is beyond all calculation.
The spark jumps through miles of air, which
is, really, an insulator. This spark represents billions and
billions of volts.</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_219"></a><i><b>219. Thunder</b></i> is caused by the violent disturbances
produced in the atmosphere by lightning. The nature of
the sound depends, among other things, upon the distance
of the observer from the discharge, and upon the
length and shape of the path taken. Clouds, hills, and
other objects produce echoes, which also modify the
original sound. It takes nearly five seconds for the
sound to travel one mile.</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_220"></a><i><b>220. Lightning-Rods</b></i>, when well constructed,
often prevent violent discharges of atmospheric electricity.
They have pointed prongs at the top, which
allow the negative of the earth (which is being attracted
by the cloud when it is positively charged) to pass
quietly into the air above; this neutralizes the cloud. In
case of a discharge, the rods aid in conducting the electricity
to the earth.</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_221"></a><i><b>221. Causes of Atmospheric Electricity.</b></i>
There are several theories about this. Some think that
it is due to the rotation of the earth, different parts being
acted upon differently by the heat of the sun.</p>

<p class="para">Some claim that the evaporation of the water in the
ocean produces it, while others say that the electrification
is produced in the clouds by the friction<span class="pagenumpara"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of their particles upon each other. The matter has
not been settled.</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_222"></a><i><b>222. St. Elmo's Fire</b></i> Electrification from the
earth is often drawn up through the masts of ships to
neutralize that in the clouds (see <a href="#PARA_220">&sect; 220</a>), and, as it escapes
from the points of the masts, light is produced. This
may be clearly shown by repeating <a href="#EXP_71">Exp. 71</a> in the dark;
the head of the pin (<a href="#FIG_39">Fig. 39</a>) will represent the end of a

<p class="para"><a id="PARA_223"></a><i><b>223. Aurora Borealis</b></i>, also called Northern Lights,

<p><a id="PARA_226"></a><b>226. Electrical Connections.</b> One must constantly join
wires, connect wires with apparatus, or connect one piece of apparatus
to another, to make the proper electrical connections. A very
simple method of connections has been used in all the apparatus
described in these experiments.</p>

<p>A little arrangement which we shall call a spring
connector, S C, (<a href="#FIG_61">Fig. 61</a>), gives us a means of quickly
making connections; that is, it does away with expensive
binding-posts. It is made of brass, nickel plated,
and may be used anywhere without affecting the magnetic
needle.</p>

<p>Six or eight wires, about No. 24 gauge, each about 1&frac12; ft.
long, should be prepared with a connector at each end. You may
use wire furnished (No. 53). Scrape the insulation from the ends
of the wires for about 1&frac12; inches, then twist the bare ends around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the connectors as shown in <a href="#FIG_61">Fig. 61</a>. The wire should pass around
tightly at least 4 or 5 times and then be twisted a little, as shown,
to help tighten it. Do not put it on so poorly or in such quantity
that the part, B, will spread.</p>

<p><a id="PARA_227"></a><b>227.</b> <a href="#FIG_62">Fig. 62</a> shows how the connector should be slipped upon
a thin piece of metal, M, like that on the galvanoscope, for example.
The wire, W, from the apparatus itself is permanently
fastened under the head of the screw, S, while the wire from any
other apparatus is one of those kept on hand as above mentioned
and connected with S C.</p>

X. When lever 3 is pressed, the current still entering C R
at C, the electricity will pass onto 3 and out at Y, and
back through X, 4 and Z to the cell. The current, then,
can be made to pass out of X or Y at will by pressing the

<p><a id="PARA_240"></a><b>240. The Galvanoscope</b> (<a href="#FIG_72">Fig. 72</a>) is more than a mere detector
of electricity. With it we shall be able to study, more fully, cells,
currents, etc., etc. We must first understand its construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="PARA_241"></a><b>241. The Coil-support</b>,
C S, is fastened to the
cross-piece, C P, on which
are the 3 binding-posts or
coil-ends, L, M and R (left,
middle, right). The legs,
G L, are screwed to C P in
such a way that C P is held
a little above the table: this
allows C S to be tipped to
the front or rear to adjust
it vertically. On account
of the peculiar arrangement
of the legs, the galvanoscope
can be made to
stand firmly, even upon
uneven surfaces. The
screws holding G L should
not be put in far enough
to tear the threads in the wood, C P.</p>

<p><a id="PARA_242"></a><b>242. The Galvanoscope Coils</b>, G C, are two in number, both
being fastened to the coil-support, C S. The first coil has five
turns of wire, its ends being fastened to L and M; the other coil
has <i>ten</i> turns, with ends at M and R. The current can, at will,
be made to pass through 5, 10 or 15 turns of wire by making the
proper connections.</p>

<p>Suppose that we have two wires direct from a cell, or from the
current reverser, with spring connectors on them so that we can
slip them onto L, M or R, which stand for left, middle or right.
When the wires are joined to L and M the current can pass
through but 5 turns; when joined to M and R it will go through
10 turns; and when to L and R it will pass through the entire 15
turns. When the current enters the galvanoscope at L and
passes out at M or R, it will pass through the turns of wire from
left to right, at the top; that is, it will pass in a "clockwise"
direction.</p>

<p><a id="PARA_243"></a><b>243. The Compass-needle</b>, furnished with O C (No. 18), will
do also for this galvanoscope. It should be placed upon the pin-point
after fixing on the pointers (<a href="#PARA_246">&sect; 246</a>). The length of the
needle should be parallel to the plane of the coil when no current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
passes; that is, the coil and coil-support should be in the N and
S line.</p>

<p>The needle can be centered in regard to right and left, and in
regard to up and down, by properly adjusting the position of the
pin-point support, P P S; this is held firmly to C S by two spring-connectors.
By removing S C, the support, P P S, may be raised
or lowered.</p>

<p><a id="PARA_244"></a><b>244. To place the coil</b> in the N and S line, simply swing the
galvanoscope bodily around, at the same time looking down upon
the needle, until the length of the needle becomes parallel to the
coil-support. When once carefully adjusted N and S, a line may
be drawn upon the table as a guide for its position in future
experiments. The coil should stand in a vertical plane, and this
straight up and down position can be easily adjusted.</p>

<p>To place the coil in the E and W line, turn it until the pointers
are at the 90&deg; (90 degree) marks,&mdash;the 0&deg; (zero degree) marks
remaining, of course, as described above.</p>

<p><a id="PARA_245"></a><b>245. The Degree-Card, G D C</b> (<a href="#FIG_72">Fig. 72</a>) has a dot at its center,
to show where to make a pin-hole for the pin that supports the
compass-needle. With this you can tell how many degrees the
needle is deflected when the current passes. This card, G D C,
should be pressed down over the pin-point. The zero points of
G D C should be N and S, also, when the coil is in that position;
that is, they should be in the plane of the coil. The pointers on
the needle (<a href="#PARA_246">&sect; 246</a>) will then be at O, when the needle is at rest,
no current passing through the coils. (See Apparatus Book
&sect; 272 for Home-Made Degree-Card.) G D C may be held permanently
in position after it is adjusted, by sticking a short pin
through it into P P S. Do not let this pin interfere, however,
with the swinging of the needle.</p>

<p><a id="PARA_270"></a><b>270. Chemical Action in the Simple Galvanic Cell.</b> The
chemical formula of sulphuric acid is H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (read H, 2, S, O, 4).
This means that it is a compound of hydrogen (H), sulphur (S),
and oxygen (O). The H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> stands for <i>molecule</i> of acid, and the
small figures show that the molecule is made up of 2 <i>atoms</i> of
hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), one of sulphur (S), and 4 of oxygen (O<sub>4</sub>). The
atoms are held together by <i>chemical attraction</i> or <i>affinity</i>.</p>

<p>There is a stronger chemical affinity between zinc (Zn) and
SO<sub>4</sub> than between H<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>4</sub>; so, as soon as the Zn gets a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>chance, as it does in the cell, it drives out the H<sub>2</sub>, and it takes its
place in the molecule. This chemical <i>reaction</i> may be shown by
the following chemical <i>equation</i>:</p>

<p class="center">Zn + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = ZnSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Zinc and sulphuric acid produce zinc sulphate and hydrogen.</p>

<p>The zinc sulphate produced weakens the effect of the acid; in
fact, the acid has to be renewed occasionally, as it is changed to
the sulphate which remains in solution.</p>

<p><a id="PARA_271"></a><b>271. Action in Cell Using Impure Zinc.</b> The above action
takes place in the cell when impure zinc is used, even when no
current passes, heat being produced by the reaction instead of
useful electricity. (See Local Currents.)</p>

<p><b>Action in Cell Using Pure Zinc.</b> When pure zinc (or impure
zinc that has been properly amalgamated) is used in the cell, it
dissolves, or is eaten away, only when the current passes. It
should be noted that the bubbles of hydrogen do not even then
appear at the zinc; they are not seen throughout the body of the
liquid. There seems to be an unseen transfer of hydrogen from
the zinc, through the liquid, to the copper (or other - plate used),
and it appears there in the shape of bubbles. The larger the
quantity of pure zinc dissolved, the stronger the current, and the
larger the amount of hydrogen produced.</p>

<p>As the zinc dissolves it parts with its latent energy, and this
energy forces the electric current through the circuit. While the
hydrogen of the decomposed acid makes its way towards the
- plate, the SO<sub>4</sub> part of it travels towards the Zn plate, where
the ZnSO<sub>4</sub> is formed. (See <a href="#PARA_270">&sect; 270</a>.)</p></div>

that when different metals were in contact with the
zinc, the zinc was rapidly dissolved by the acid. The
impurities in the zinc act like the copper plate in the
simple cell, thus producing <i>local currents</i> in the zinc,
which rapidly destroy it without doing any good. These
currents pass from zinc to impurities, and back to the
zinc, without going out into the main wire. This local
action takes place even when the main circuit is open.</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_274"></a><i><b>274. Reasons for Amalgamating Zinc Plates.</b></i>
Pure zinc is not affected by dilute sulphuric acid, but it
is too expensive to use in cells; so amalgamated zinc is
used instead, because it is cheaper, and acts the same as
pure zinc. The impurities are removed from the surface
of the zinc, as the zinc alone is dissolved by the mercury.
There is, then, a liquid layer of pure zinc with mercury
upon the surface of the amalgamated plate. This is not
acted upon by the acid when the circuit is open. A
stronger and more regular current is produced with amalgamated
zinc than with the impure unamalgamated zinc.</p>

little weaker, of course, as it is decomposed by the zinc
(<a href="#PARA_270">&sect; 270</a>), but the chief cause of the weakening of the current
is hydrogen, which forms a filmy coating upon the
copper plate. This coating even seems to soak into the
copper, and it takes some time for it to be thoroughly
removed. The zinc plate is kept comparatively free from
hydrogen by amalgamation.</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_279"></a><i><b>279. Effects of Polarization.</b></i> The hydrogen
bubbles weaken the current in at least two ways. In the

it holds the current back, as any other resistance would.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, acid acts upon hydrogen as it would upon
another metal. When the copper plate becomes well
covered with hydrogen, the acid cannot touch it; so we
really have a <i>hydrogen plate</i> in the cell. Hydrogen acts
very much like zinc in the acid; we say that it is more
electro-positive than copper. The result is, then, that a
new current starts up, and as this is towards the zinc, in
the acid, it partially destroys or neutralizes the main zinc-to-copper
current. Practical use is made of the principles
of polarization (see Secondary Batteries).</p>

circulation of the liquid. <i>Chemical action</i> is another
means by which the hydrogen may be side-tracked before
it gets to the - plate in single-fluid cells. Substances like

<p><a id="PARA_290"></a><b>290. The Daniell Cell</b>, of which the two-fluid cell used in <a href="#EXP_112">Exp.

little over 1 volt, and it should be kept working through a resistance
when not in regular use; it should not be left in open circuit.
The porous cup keeps the two fluids from mixing, but it does not
stop the current.</p>

<p><a id="PARA_291"></a><b>291. The Gravity Cell</b> is a form of the above. As one of the
fluids is heavier than the other, no porous cup is needed. Gravity,
together with the action of the current, tends to keep the fluids
separated. A copper plate is placed in the bottom of the jar, and
upon this is put the copper sulphate solution. The zinc plate is
supported by the top of the jar and rests in a solution of zinc
sulphate, which is lighter than the blue solution below. An
insulated wire extends from the copper through the liquids. This
cell is used for telegraph and similar work. (See Apparatus Book
for Home-Made Gravity Cell, its Regulation, etc.)</p></div>

Although some of the pairs of metals furnished so weak
a current that it was necessary to use the astatic galvanoscope

iron is electropositive to copper, as the current flowed from iron

electronegative to those above it and electropositive to those
below it; that is, the list should have the most electropositive
metal at the top, and the one least acted upon by the acid at the
bottom. Make such a list from your results. The farther the
metals used are apart in the <i>list</i>, the greater will be the E. M. F. of

<a href="#FIG_85">Fig. 85</a>. Have about 3 in. of acid in one tumbler, and

were joined. The large cell will give a stronger current,
under certain conditions, than the small one; but this
depends upon other things than E. M. F. (See experiments
under Current Strength.) A zinc-copper cell,

this is called <i>internal resistance</i>.
(See <a href="#PARA_314">&sect; 314</a>.) The strength of the

it has a cross-section of about 1 sq. mm., at a temperature

to affect the resistance. For the use of students, 9 ft. 9
in. of No. 30 copper wire, or 39 ft. 1 in. of No. 24 copper
wire will make a fairly good ohm. We might, of

<p class="para"><a id="PARA_314"></a><i><b>314. Internal Resistance.</b></i> As found in <a href="#EXP_120">Exp. 120</a>,
pure water is not a good conductor of galvanic electricity.
The acid in the simple cell, and in other single-fluid cells,
acts upon the zinc and at the same time makes it possible
for the current to pass, as it reduces the internal resistance.</p>

<p class="para">As seen later, this resistance in cells is greatly diminished
by bringing the plates near each other, and by increasing
the surface of the plates that are in contact with
the acid. The larger the plates the less the internal resistance,

<p><a id="EXP_121"></a><b>EXPERIMENT 121. To find what effect the length of a
wire has upon its electrical resistance.</b></p>

<div class="appblock">
<p><i>Apparatus.</i> A No. 30 German-silver wire, G-S W, a
little over two meters long, un-insulated (No. 81); the
two-fluid cell, 2-F C (<a href="#EXP_113">Exp. 113</a>); galvanoscope, G V (No.
58); plate binding-posts, X, Y and Z (No. 83&ndash;84&ndash;85);
copper washers (No. 87).</p>

<p><i>Arrange</i> as in <a href="#FIG_96">Fig. 96</a>, so that the current will flow, at
first, as shown by the arrow. The metal plates, M P 1
and M P 2, are used so that the connections may be
changed without disturbing G V. The binding-posts may
be fastened directly to the top of the table; but it will be
more convenient to permanently fix them to a board, B,
as shown, so that the same arrangement can be used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
future experiments. The binding-posts, X and Y, should
be about &#8539; in. apart, just far enough so that their edges
do not touch each other.</p>

<p>The binding-post, Z, should be fastened to B with its
inside end 1 meter(100 centimeters, cm.) from the ends of
X and Y. Marks should be made upon B, 10 centimeters
apart, as indicated by the cross lines. This distance may
be taken from the scale on the rule (No. 88).</p>

<p>Fasten one end of the No. 30 wire, G-S W, to X. To
do this twist its end around the screw, S, between X and
the copper washer, then turn the screw in with a screw-driver
until it firmly holds X to the board. Pass the
wire around the screw in Z, and bring its free end to the
other binding-post, Y, to be fastened (<a href="#FIG_96">Fig. 96</a>). Two
meters of wire then form a path for the current from X
to Y. Have the board wide enough so that another set
of binding-posts can be put by the side of Y. It will be
best to permanently leave the No. 30 wire upon the board,
and to fasten the No. 28 wire (next experiment) to another
set of binding-posts, placed in the same manner as
those in <a href="#FIG_96">Fig. 96</a>. Make holes in the wood with an awl
before forcing in the screws.</p></div>

<p><a id="PARA_315"></a><b>315. Note.</b> This experiment is usually done with a reverser
in the circuit, first taking readings with the current passing in
one direction, and then in the opposite direction. Considerable
time will be saved by taking all the readings for one direction of
the current at a time, simply using different lengths of German-silver
wire, and allowing the current to flow constantly during
each part. This obviates all danger of poor contacts in the
reverser, etc.; it saves the trouble of handling the reverser, and
much of the time needed for the needle to come to rest.</p>

<p><a id="EXP_126"></a><b>EXPERIMENT 126. To measure the resistance of a wire

<div class="appblock">
<p><i>Apparatus.</i> Same as in <a href="#EXP_125">Exp. 125</a>; the two-ohm resistance
coil, R C (No. 79); a coil of wire, X, as, for example,
the 15-turn coil on the galvanoscope, G V (No. 58).</p>

<p><i>Arrange</i> as in <a href="#FIG_105">Fig. 105</a>. You will observe that the central
conductor of the bridge (2, <a href="#FIG_104">Fig. 104</a>) takes the place
of M P in previous explanations. We still have the same
kind of a divided circuit as explained in <a href="#EXP_125">Exp. 125</a>, A G
being connected with points of equal potential. It will
be found convenient to have D C at the right, and A G
facing you at the left, the key being in front. (See <a href="#EXP_107">Exp.
107</a> in regard to adjusting A G.)</p>

<p>Notice that you have a standard resistance (2 ohms)
in place of R, <a href="#FIG_102">Fig. 102</a>, and an unknown resistance (galvanoscope
coil) in place of X. (See <a href="#PARA_330">&sect; 330</a>.)</p></div>

<p><a id="PARA_329"></a><b>329. Directions.</b> (A) Touch the free end of wire, 3, to the
left-hand side of the bridge-wire, press the key for an instant,
only, and note the direction taken by the right-hand end of the
needle. Move the end of wire, 3, to the right-hand side of the
bridge-wire, touch key, watching needle. Does the needle move
more or less than before? In the same or opposite direction? If
the deflections are opposite, the point that has the same potential
as binding-post, 2, must be <i>between</i> the two points touched.</p>

<p>(B) Be sure that all connections are good. Find the point on
G-s W, at which there is no deflection, as directed in <a href="#EXP_125">Exp. 125</a>
(C). Note the readings on the scale, as explained in <a href="#PARA_324">&sect; 324</a>.</p>

<p>(C) Make the proper calculation, <a href="#PARA_327">&sect; 327</a>, 328, and find the resistance
of the coil of G V, the resistances of the wires joining R C
and G V to the bridge being neglected.</p>

<p>(D) Make proper allowances for the resistances of the wires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
just mentioned (see <a href="#PARA_330">&sect; 330</a>), and compare them with the results
found in part (C).</p>

<p><a id="PARA_330"></a><b>330. Allowances for connections.</b> It should be remembered
that the wires joining R C and G V to the bridge also have some
resistance. Such connections, in regular instruments, are made
by heavy copper straps or by thick, short wires, so that their resistances
can be neglected. In case you use the ordinary No. 24
copper wire, as directed, the resistances of the pieces can be measured
by means of the bridge, or you can calculate their resistances
from the wire tables. The resistances should be allowed for. It
is evident that your standard resistance is 2 ohms <i>plus</i> the resistance
of the connecting wires, and that the resistance of the coil, X,
is found by deducting the resistance of its connecting wires from
that found from the proportion previously used.</p>

<p><i>Example.</i> We see from the table that the resistance of about 39 ft.
1 in. of No. 24, B and S copper wire is 1 ohm. This equals 469
in. If 469 in. have a R (resistance) of 1 ohm, 1 in. will have a
R of one-469th of an ohm; that is 1 divided by 469, which equals
a little over .002 ohm. For every inch of No. 24 wire used, then,
for connections, we may allow .002 ohm. This will be near
enough for our purposes.</p>

<p>Suppose that each connection is 18 in. long, the regular wires
with connectors being used. The R of the 36 in. joined to R C
will then be 36 times .002 = .072 ohm. Our standard R must
then be considered as 2.072 ohm. If we substitute this in the
example, as stated in <a href="#PARA_328">&sect; 328</a>, we have 3.7 &times; X = 6.3 &times; 2.072. X
must equal (6.3 &times; 2.072)/3.7 = 3.528 ohm, which includes the
unknown resistance and 36 in. of connections, the R of which is
.002 ohm; 3.528 - .072 = 3.456, the resistance of X alone. Compare
this with the answer to example, <a href="#PARA_328">&sect; 328</a>. Make allowances
according to length of connectors used.</p></div>

<p><a id="PARA_333"></a><b>333. Directions.</b> (A) Measure the resistance of the coil of

Spring connectors are fastened to the ends of this coil,
allowing it to be directly connected to the conductor on the bridge,
so no allowance should be made for its connecting wires. (See
<a href="#EXP_126">Exp. 126</a> for details.) Mark the resistance upon the coil for future

<p><b>Note.</b> The student will be surprised, perhaps, to find that
different results are obtained for the resistance of a given wire in
case he uses different standard resistances in the various tests;
that is, he will probably get a different result in <a href="#EXP_127">Exp. 127</a> (A)
from the result of <a href="#EXP_127">Exp. 127</a> (B). The difference here, however,
may not be large. The best results are obtained by making the
standard resistance as nearly equal as possible to the resistance
to be measured, so that a balance can be found when the end of
wire 3 (<a href="#FIG_105">Fig. 105</a>) is near the center of the bridge-wire. If R, <a href="#FIG_105">Fig.
105</a>, is much larger or smaller than X, the point desired on G-s W
will be near one of its ends, and large errors thereby produced.
The approximate resistance of X can be found by trial, then more
or less resistance can be used for R to suit. The student should
make several coils as explained in Apparatus Book, Chapter
XVII. The resistance of the different coils furnished should be
measured and marked. These can be used to vary the value
of R.</p></div>

resistance of a wire is directly proportional to its length,
provided its cross-section, material, etc., are uniform.</i></p>

<div class="expblock">

<p><b>EXAMPLE.</b> If 39.1 ft. of No. 24 copper wire has a resistance
of 1 ohm, 78.2 ft. will have a resistance of 2 ohms, because 78.2
is twice 39.1; 70.38 ft. will have a resistance of 1.8 ohms, as
(70.38 &divide; 39.1 = 1.8) it is 1.8 times 39.1.</p></div>

<p>2. <i>The resistance of a wire is inversely proportional to its
area of cross-section.</i> The areas of cross-section of round
wires vary as the squares of their diameters; so <i>the
resistance of a wire is also inversely proportional to the
square of its diameter, other things being equal</i>.</p>

<div class="expblock">

<p><b>EXAMPLE.</b> A No. 30 wire has a diameter of about .01 inch,
while the diameter of a No. 24 wire is about .02 in.; that is, the
No. 24 has <i>twice</i> the diam. that the No. 30 has. The area of
cross-section of the No. 24, however, is four times that of the
No. 30, so its resistance is but &frac14; that of the No. 30, the lengths,
etc., being the same. (See <a href="#Page_208">Wire Tables</a>.)</p>

<p class="para"><a id="PARA_350"></a><i><b>350. Strength of Current.</b></i> The water in a certain
tank may be under great pressure, but if it is obliged
to pass through long tubes before it can turn a water-wheel,
for example, it is evident that the work done will
depend not only upon the pressure in the tank, but upon
the resistance to be overcome before the water gets to
the wheel. The work that the water can do depends
upon its <i>rate of flow</i>, and may be used to measure the
<i>strength</i> of the current.</p>

<p class="para">The strength of a current of electricity is measured
also by the <i>work</i> that it can do, and it depends upon its

<p class="para"><a id="PARA_351"></a><i><b>351. Unit of Current Strength; The Ampere.</b></i>
A current having the strength of 1 ampere, when passed
through a solution of silver nitrate under proper conditions,
will deposit 0.001118 gramme of silver in <i>one
second</i>; if passed through a solution of copper sulphate,
copper plates being used for the electrodes, in the solution,
0.0003277 gramme of copper will be deposited in <i>one
second</i>. (See Chemical Effects of the Current.) The
thousandth of an ampere is called the milliampere. The
strength of a current is proportional to the amount of
chemical work that it can do per second. (See <a href="#PARA_357">&sect; 357</a>.)</p>

(See Elementary Electrical Examples.) There

its special work. They are often calibrated or standardized

In speaking of the <i>quantity</i> of electricity we introduce
the element of <i>time</i>. The unit of quantity is called the
<i>coulomb</i>, just as a cubic foot of water may be taken as a
unit of quantity for water. A coulomb is the quantity
of electricity given, in one second, by a current having a
strength of 1 ampere. Coulombs are found by multiplying
amperes by seconds; thus, a current of 5 amperes

<p>Now let the internal resistance, r, be slightly increased from 2

<p class="para"><a id="PARA_373"></a><i><b>373. Electromotive Force of Polarization.</b></i>
We know that H and O have a strong chemical attraction,

current to decompose water, this attraction between the
gases must be overcome; and as soon as the current
ceases, these gases try to rush together again to form
water. This sets up an electromotive force of almost 1.5
volts; in fact, a current is produced if the H and O be allowed
to form water again (See Storage Cells). To decompose
water the current must have an E. M. F. of
over 1.5 volts to overcome this E. M. F. of polarization.
It was seen in the study of simple cells that the current
became rapidly weaker as hydrogen was deposited upon
the copper plate, on account of this opposing electromotive
force.</p>

<p class="para">In decomposing other compounds, the anode is made

copper is to be deposited from a solution of copper sulphate
the anode should be a copper plate; this keeps the

<p class="para"><a id="PARA_396"></a><i><b>396. Electromagnets</b></i> are important to the student
of electricity. They form the principal part of nearly
every electrical instrument. You have seen that a wire
has a magnetic field about it the instant a current passes
through it. A coil, or helix of wire, has a stronger field
than a straight wire carrying the same current, because
each turn, or convolution, adds its field to the fields of
the other turns. By having a <i>core</i> of soft iron instead of
air, wood, or other non-magnetic material, the strength
of the magnet is greatly increased. The central core
may be permanently fixed in the coil, or it may be removable.
(See Apparatus Book, Chapter IX, for Home-made
Electromagnets.)</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_397"></a><i><b>397. Cores of Electromagnets.</b></i> A strong magnet
has more lines of force passing from its N pole through
the air to its S pole than a weak magnet. By increasing
the number of lines of force we increase the strength of
a magnet. It has been seen, in experiments with permanent
magnets, that lines of force do not pass as readily
through air as through soft iron, and that lines of force
will go out of their way to pass through iron. It was
learned in <a href="#EXP_154">Exp. 154</a> that inside of a helix (<a href="#FIG_123">Fig. 123</a>) the
lines of force pass from the S to the N pole; they then
spread out through the air and pass back on all sides of
the coil to its S pole, as in the case of permanent magnets.
The air around and inside of a helix offers a great resistance
to the lines of force, and tends to weaken the<span class="pagenumpara"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
magnetic field. When part of the circuit consists of an
iron core, which is a splendid conductor of lines of force,
the magnetic field is greatly increased in strength.</p>

shows a simple form of electromagnet with two coils
which have a bent piece of iron as a core for both. The
coils have to be wound on by hand in this form. As this
is troublesome, the coils are generally wound on two
separate cores which are joined by a <i>yoke</i> (<a href="#PARA_406">&sect; 406</a>), which
takes the place of the curved part in <a href="#FIG_128">Fig. 128</a>. The
separate coils can be quickly made with a "winder" and
joined to suit. (See Apparatus Book, Chapter IX, for
Home-made Electromagnets.) <a href="#FIG_129">Fig. 129</a> shows a top view<span class="pagenumpara"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of a home-made experimental horseshoe electromagnet.
The coils are joined by an iron strap, called the <i>yoke</i>,
which is screwed to a wooden base. A strip of iron
placed above the magnets to be attracted by them, when
the current passes, is called the <i>armature</i>. (See Telegraph
Sounders.)</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_406"></a><i><b>406. Use of Yoke.</b></i> It has been explained (<a href="#PARA_82">&sect; 82</a>)
why horseshoe magnets are, in general, better than
straight ones. The same is true of electromagnets; there
are two poles to attract, and two to induce. The lines
of force pass through the yoke on their way from one
core to the other, and this reduces the resistance to them.
The strength of the horseshoe magnet would be greatly
reduced if the lines of force were obliged to pass through
two air spaces instead of one; in fact, if there were no
yoke we should have simply two straight magnets. The
yoke should be made of soft iron.</p>

<p><a id="PARA_408"></a><b>408. Method of Joining Coils.</b> To produce the best results
the poles of the horseshoe electromagnet should be unlike. As
the coils are wound alike, their ends
must be joined in such a manner that
the current will pass around them in
opposite directions; that is, if the current
enters one coil at the outside end, O E,
it must enter the other coil at the
inside end, I E. <a href="#FIG_132">Fig. 132</a> shows a plan
of the connections, spring connectors
being fastened to the coil-ends, to allow
rapid and easy changes in the arrangement.
L, M, and R are pieces of metal
fastened to a strip of wood (No. 95), used
to make connections from cells or other
apparatus. They are turned up at each
end as in <a href="#FIG_104">Fig. 104</a>, 3. Care should be
taken not to get short circuits by allowing two wires to touch the
tin base.</p>

<p>By changing the ends of the coils upon L, M, and R (left, middle,
and right), and by changing the direction in which the current
enters the "combination connecting plates" (No. 95), it is
evident that the nature of the poles can be regulated to suit.</p></div>

paper is best, so that the filings will show plainly, and but a thin
coating of paraffine should be given. Place the magnets upon
the table, lay over them a piece of unparaffined paper, and fix
the paraffine paper directly over this. This is necessary, as the
coated paper sticks when heated. For electromagnets it will be
necessary to support the edges of the paper with books, etc.
Sprinkle on the filings and tap the paper to make them arrange
themselves while the circuit is closed. After the lines of force
show plainly, the current need not be used again, provided the
paper be kept perfectly still. Pass the flame of a Bunsen burner
over the paper to melt the coating. This will, no doubt, make

particles of filings in place. Do not heat the paper too much&mdash;just
enough to melt the paraffine. If you have no gas, hold a
fire-shovel, containing hot coals, over the paper. As soon as the
paraffine cools, the figures will stand considerable handling.</p>

<p><i>Blue print figures</i> are very pretty, and last indefinitely. Get
some blue-print paper at a photographer's, who will give you
directions about "developing" it with water. Keep this in the
dark, and take out but one sheet at a time for experiments. To
make the figures, take your apparatus near a window where
bright sunlight comes in. Pull down the curtain so that you have
but a dim light when you make the magnetic figure, as directed
before. After the lines of force show plainly, raise the curtain,
and let the bright sunlight shine on it for 5 or 6 minutes, or until
the surface of the paper has a rich, bronze color. The paper
cannot be acted upon by the light under the particles of filings.
Quickly shake the filings from the paper, and wash it in 3 changes
of water to "develop" it, then pin the paper up to dry.</p></div>

in the study of the permanent horseshoe magnet, that the

closed the magnetic circuit, the lines of force having
almost no resistance. In the case of electromagnets the
magnetic circuit becomes closed when the armature
touches both poles at the same time. The armature
clings strongly to the poles even after the current ceases
to flow. As soon as the magnetic circuit is broken,
however, but little residual magnetism remains. The
armatures of electromagnets are usually arranged so that
they can not quite touch the cores, to avoid this sticking.</p>

<p>Straighten the hairpins and scrape the coating off with sandpaper

about the ends of the hairpins (<a href="#FIG_134">Fig. 134</a>), and then fasten the
hairpins to the block. They may be held firmly by small nails
which should be driven partly into the block and bent over. The

but not touching each other. This allows all to be heated at the

<p>A thermopile in the form of a circle with several pairs of metals,
can easily be made by fastening the hairpins to a piece of

<p class="para"><a id="PARA_423"></a><i><b>423. Thermoelectricity</b></i> is produced by heating
the junction between two metals. Different pairs of metals
produce different results. Antimony and bismuth are
often used. If the end of a strip of bismuth be soldered
to the end of a similar strip of antimony, and the free
ends be connected to a galvanometer of low resistance, the
presence of a current will be shown when the point of
contact becomes hotter than the rest of the circuit. The
current will flow from the bismuth to antimony across the
joint. By cooling the junction below the temperature of
the rest of the circuit a current will be produced in the
opposite direction.</p>

<p>Thermoelectric currents have a low potential. The
energy of the current is kept up by the heat absorbed.</p>

can be reversed; that is, if a current from a battery be
sent through the metals, the parts at the junction become
slightly warmer or cooler than before, depending upon
the direction of the current. This is known as the <i>Peltier
Effect</i>, the heat not being due to the resistance to the
current.</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_425"></a><i><b>425. Thermopiles.</b></i> As the E. M. F. of the current
produced by a single pair of metals is small, several
pairs are usually joined in series in such a way that the
different currents help each other and flow in the same
direction. Such combinations, usually made of antimony
and bismuth, are called thermoelectric piles, or simply
thermopiles. They are useful in detecting very small differences
in temperature. The heat of a match, or the cold
of a piece of ice, will produce a current even at some distance,
the thermopile being connected with a sensitive
short-coil astatic galvanometer. (See "Things a Boy

<p class="para"><a id="PARA_426"></a><i><b>426. Electromagnetic Induction.</b></i> You have
seen, by experiments, that a magnet has the power to induce
another piece of iron or steel to become a magnet.
You have also seen, in the study of static electricity, that
an electrified body has the power to act through space
upon another conductor. A body may be polarized and
charged with static electricity by induction.</p>

<p class="para">Several questions now come up. Can a <i>current</i> of electricity
in a conductor induce a <i>current</i> in another conductor
not in any way connected with the first? Can
current electricity produce effects through space? Is
there an electromagnetic induction?</p>

<p class="para">It has been seen that a current-carrying wire has a
magnetic field, and that magnetic fields can act through
space. It is evident, then, that a conductor will be surrounded
and cut by lines of force when it is placed in a
magnetic field, or near a wire or coil through which a current
passes. Let us study this by experiments.</p>

the coil ends and wires,
3 and 4, which are
attached to the galvanoscope.
It is best to
use the wires, 3 and 4,
so that the coil will be
2 feet at least, from
A G; otherwise the needle of A G might be affected by the
magnet, M (No. 97).</p>

<p>(B) Get clearly in mind in which direction the right-hand end of
the needle is deflected when a current enters A G at L, the left-hand
binding-post. If you have forgotten the results of previous
experiments, use the cell for an instant, touching the wire from
the carbon to L and that from the zinc to R. If any currents
come from the coil, later, you should be able to tell in which
direction they flow, the coil and A G forming a closed circuit.</p>

<p>(C) Hold the magnet, M, as shown, and quickly push it into the
coil until it has the place of a core, at the same time watching the
needle. If a current is produced, in which direction does it flow
from the coil? Does the needle remain deflected? Is the current
constant or temporary?</p>

<p>(D) After the magnet, M, has been placed in the coil, as in (C),

the coil in the same direction as before, in (C)?</p>

<p class="para"><a id="PARA_428"></a><i><b>428. Discussion.</b></i> An induced current, produced
as in the above experiment, is a momentary one. No
current passes when the magnet and coil are still; at least
one of them has to be in motion. When the magnet is
inserted, the induced current is said to be an <i>inverse</i> one,
as it passes in a direction opposite to that which would be
necessary to give the magnet its poles, it being considered<span class="pagenumpara"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
a core magnetized by the current. A <i>direct</i> current is
produced when the magnet is withdrawn from the coil.
Rapid movements produce stronger currents than slow
ones. (See <a href="#PARA_439">&sect; 439</a>.)</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_429"></a><i><b>429. Induced Currents and Work.</b></i> It takes
force to move a magnet through the center of a coil, and
it is this work that is the source of the induced current.
When the coil is pushed on to the magnet, or when it is
moved through a magnetic field, force is also required.
We have, in this simple experiment, the key to the action
of the dynamo and other important electrical machines.
These will be discussed later.</p>

<p class="para"><a id="PARA_432"></a><i><b>432. Induced Currents and Lines of Force.</b></i>
In the experiments just given, it should be remembered
that the permanent magnets are sending out thousands
of lines of force from their N poles, and receiving them
again at their S poles. As the magnet is pushed into
the coil (<a href="#EXP_175">Exp. 175</a>), the lines of force not only cut
through the turns of the coil, but the number of lines of
force that cut the coil at any instant varies rapidly as the
magnet is moved.</p>

<p class="para">Motion is necessary, with this arrangement, to make a
change in the number of cutting lines of force. The current
passes only while the magnet moves; and the direction
of the current at any moment depends upon whether
the number of lines of force is increasing or decreasing
at that moment. (See <a href="#PARA_438">&sect; 438</a>, 439.)</p>

Special machines (see Dynamos) are constructed in which
the coils are wound so that they can be given a rapid
<i>rotary motion</i> as they fly past strong electromagnets. In
this way the coil can keep on passing the same magnets,
in the same direction, as long as force is applied to the
shaft that carries them.</p>

and induce a current in a neighboring coil. The lines of
force which reach out from an electromagnet will generate
a current in any conductor which happens to be in the
field, or which is moved across the lines. It is evident,
then, since the lines of force from each turn of a coil cut
all the other turns of the same coil, that each turn acts as
a conductor placed in the field of every other turn. The
instant a current begins to flow through a coil, there is an
inverse current of self-induction started in the coil, which
opposes the current in the cell. When the circuit is
broken, this <i>extra current</i>, as it is also called, is a direct
one and adds its strength to that of the current from the
cell; as this takes place at the instant the circuit is broken,
a bright spark is seen at the key, and this shows that the
E. M. F. of this extra current is high. Practical uses
are made of it.</p>

then automatically separated, and the current passes from
one to the other, causing the "arc." The resistance of
the air-space is reduced by the intensely heated vapor
and flying particles of carbon.</p>


<p class="para"><a id="PARA_486"></a><i><b>486. The Incandescent Lamp</b></i> consists of a glass
bulb, in which is a vacuum, and the light is caused by
the passage of a current through a thin fibre of vegetable
carbon, enclosed in the vacuum. The fibre would burn
instantly if allowed to come in contact with the air. The
fibres have a high resistance, and are easily heated to
incandescence.</p>

<span class="f75">WIRE TABLES.</span></h3>


<p><i>Copper Wire Tables</i> are very convenient, and a necessity
when working electrical examples. The tables here given
are taken from a dealer's catalogue, and will be found
sufficiently accurate for ordinary work.</p>

<p><i>Explanation of Tables.</i> In the <i>first</i> column are given
the sizes of wires by numbers. The B &amp; S or American
gauge is used. In the table below is given a comparison
between the B &amp; S and the Birmingham gauges.</p>

<p>The <i>second column</i> gives the diameters of wires. The
diameter of No. 36 wire is 5 thousandths of an inch; the
diameter of No. 24 wire is a little over 20 thousandths or
2 hundredths of an inch.</p>

<p>The <i>third column</i> contains what is called circular mils,
a mil being a thousandth of an inch. The figures in this
column are obtained by squaring those in the second;
thus, for No. 36 wire, 5 &times; 5 = 25. This column is useful
when working examples where the squares of the
diameters are wanted. The rest of the table explains
itself.</p>

<p>The table at the bottom gives a comparison between
the fractional and decimal parts of an inch. Space can
not be given here for a series of examples showing the
many uses of this table. (See "Elementary Electrical
Examples.")</p>

A, B, shown in plan.</p>

<p><b>No. 95.</b> Combination connecting plates (<a href="#FIG_132">Fig. 132</a>). Three
aluminum straps are fastened to a wooden base. They are
turned up at their ends so that spring connectors can be easily
pushed upon them.</p>

<p><b>No. 96.</b> One long iron core (L I C, <a href="#FIG_140">Fig. 140</a>). This is of soft
iron, 5/16 in. in diameter, and long enough to pass through both
coils (No. 89, 90).</p>

<p><b>No. 97.</b> Bar magnet, about 4 in. long and 5/16 in. in diameter.</p>

<p><b>No. 98.</b> Coil of insulated wire wound on a soft iron core, to
act as a primary coil for induction experiments. This coil fits
inside of the hollow coils (Nos. 89, 90).</p>

<p><b>No. 99.</b> A printed degree-card for the galvanoscope (No. 58).
This is printed on stiff cardboard, about 3 in. in diameter.</p>

<p><b>No. 100.</b> A printed scale for the Wheatstone's bridge (No. 80).
This is printed on stiff paper. The scale is 8 in. long, and is
divided into 10 large divisions, each of which is subdivided into
10 parts, thus making 100 parts in all.</p>

<h3><a name="A_Word" id="A_Word"></a>A Word to Parents About Games and
Educational Amusements.</h3>


<p>Systematic play is as important as systematic
work. The best games and home amusements
are as valuable to a child as school-studies; in
fact, they bring out and stimulate qualities in
a child, which no school-study can. Fascinating
home amusements are as necessary as school-books.</p>

<p>Boys and girls like to be busy. Their amusements
should be entered into as heartily, chosen
as carefully, and purchased as willingly as
school-books.</p>

<p><b>Games.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jingo</span> and <span class="smcap">Hustle-Ball</span> are good
games.</p>

<ul class="index">
<li>They are interesting and full of action.</li>

<li>They arouse a child's common-sense.</li>

<li>They cultivate an ability to think rapidly,
judge correctly, and decide quickly.</li>

<li>They educate the eye and hand at the same time.</li>

<li>They are very simple, and may be played at
once.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Educational Amusements.</b>&mdash;There is a peculiar
fascination about Electricity and Magnetism,
which makes these subjects appeal to every
boy and girl.</p>

<p>There is nothing better than science studies,
to teach children to observe and to see what they
look at; besides, it is <i>fun</i> to experiment. "Fun
With Electricity" and "Fun With Magnetism"
are educational amusements. They contain
fascinating experiments and are systematically
arranged.</p>

<h3><a name="Juvenile_Work" id="Juvenile_Work"></a>Juvenile Work in Electricity.<br />
<span class="f75"><i>From The Electrical Engineer, May 19, 1898.</i></span></h3>

<p>The position that Young America is now taking in
the electric and magnetic field is very clearly shown
at the Electrical Show now being held at Madison Square
Garden, by an exhibit of simple experimental apparatus
made by young boys from the Browning School, of this
city.</p>

<p>The models shown cover every variety of apparatus
that is dear to the heart of a boy, and yet, along the
whole line from push-buttons to motors, one is struck by
the extreme simplicity of design and the ingenious uses
made of old tin tomato cans, cracker boxes, bolts, screws,
wire, and the wood that a boy can get from a soap box.</p>

<p>The apparatus in this exhibit was made by boys 13,
14 and 15 years of age, from designs made by Mr.
Thomas M. St. John, of the Browning School. It clearly
shows that good, practical apparatus can be made from
cheap materials by an average boy. The whole exhibit
is wired and in working order, and it attracts the attention
of a large number of parents and boys who hover
around to see, in operation, the telegraph instruments,
buzzers, shocking coils, current detectors, motors, etc.</p>

<p>Mr. St. John deserves the thanks of every boy who
wants to build his own electrical apparatus for amusement
or for experimental purposes, as he has made the designs
extremely simple, and has kept constantly in mind the
fact that the average boy has but a limited supply of
pocket money, and an equally limited supply of tools.</p>

<p>"The author of this book is a teacher and writer of great ingenuity,
and we imagine that the effect of such a book as this falling into Juvenile
hands must be highly stimulating and beneficial. It is full of explicit
details and instructions in regard to a great variety of apparatus, and the
materials required are all within the compass of very modest pocket-money.
Moreover, it is systematic and entirely without rhetorical frills,
so that the student can go right along without being diverted from good
helpful work that will lead him to build useful apparatus and make him
understand what he is about. The drawings are plain and excellent. We
heartily commend the book."&mdash;<i>Electrical Engineer.</i></p>

<p>"Those who visited the electrical exhibition last May cannot have
failed to notice on the south gallery a very interesting exhibit, consisting,
as it did, of electrical apparatus made by boys. The various devices there
shown, comprising electro-magnets, telegraph keys and sounders, resistance
coils, etc., were turned out by boys following the instructions given
in the book with the above title, which is unquestionably one of the most
practical little works yet written that treat of similar subjects, for with
but a limited amount of mechanical knowledge, and by closely following
the instructions given, almost any electrical device may be made at very
small expense. That such a book fills a long-felt want may be inferred
from the number of inquiries we are constantly receiving from persons
desiring to make their own induction coils and other apparatus."&mdash;<i>Electricity.</i></p>

<p>"At the electrical show in New York last May one of the most interesting
exhibits was that of simple electrical apparatus made by the boys
in one of the private schools in the city. This apparatus, made by boys of
thirteen to fifteen years of age, was from designs by the author of this
clever little book, and it was remarkable to see what an ingenious use had
been made of old tin tomato-cans, cracker-boxes, bolts, screws, wire, and
wood. With these simple materials telegraph instruments, coils, buzzers,
current detectors, motors, switches, armatures, and an almost endless
variety of apparatus were made. In his book Mr. St. John has given
directions in simple language for making and using these devices, and has
illustrated these directions with admirable diagrams and cuts. The little
volume is unique, and will prove exceedingly helpful to those of our
young readers who are fortunate enough to possess themselves of a copy.
For schools where a course of elementary science is taught, no better text-book
in the first-steps in electricity is obtainable."&mdash;<i>The Great Round
World.</i></p>

<p>Children like to do experiments; and in this way, better than in
any other, <i>a practical knowledge of the elements of magnetism</i> may be
obtained.</p>

<p>These experiments, although arranged to amuse boys and girls,
have been found to be very <i>useful in the class-room</i> to supplement
the ordinary exercises given in text-books of science.</p>

<p>To secure the best <i>possible quality of apparatus</i>, the horseshoe
magnets were made at Sheffield, England, especially for these sets.
They are new and strong. Other parts of the apparatus have also
been selected and made with great care, to adapt them particularly
to these experiments.&mdash;<i>From the author's preface.</i></p>

<p>A Thorough War Game:&mdash;Infantry Against
Infantry, Cavalry Against Cavalry, Etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jingo is really a great war contest between England and
America. Upon the game-board are 14 beautiful war scenes,
each lithographed in 8 colors. American and English flags, coats
of arms, cannon, torpedoes, etc., aid in making this game
artistic, handsome and attractive. The following companies,
ships, etc., are shown:&mdash;<i>American</i>, 12th U. S. Infantry,&mdash;6th
U. S. Cavalry,&mdash;2d U. S. Light Artillery,&mdash;U. S. Mortar Battery,&mdash;U.
S. Monitor "Miantonomoh,"&mdash;U. S. Ram "Katahdin,"&mdash;U.
S. Battleship "Indiana,"&mdash;U. S. Torpedo Boat "Cushing,"&mdash;U.
S Dynamite Cruiser "Vesuvius." <i>English</i>, 30th East Lancashire,&mdash;1st
Royal Dragoons,&mdash;Royal Horse Artillery,&mdash;Royal

M. S. "Nile,"&mdash;H. M. S. "Australia,"&mdash;H. M. S. "Dart."</p>

<p>The game board is over 16 inches square when opened. Jingo
is made and finished in a manner which makes it the most beautiful,
artistic, and practical game ever published.</p>
